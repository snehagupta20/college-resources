# Assignment 8

### Aim: 
Program to implement termination detection.

### Theory:
Termination detection is a distributed algorithm that determines whether a set of distributed processes have all finished executing. It is a critical component of many distributed systems, such as distributed databases and cloud computing platforms. Termination detection ensures that the system can safely shut down or proceed to the next phase of execution, even in the presence of failures.

Code Implementation: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

using namespace std;

class Process {
private:
  int id;
  bool isFinished;
  mutex mtx;

public:
  Process(int id) {
    this->id = id;
    this->isFinished = false;
  }

  void run() {
    // Simulate process execution

    // Set the finished flag to true
    mtx.lock();
    isFinished = true;
    mtx.unlock();
  }

  bool isFinished() {
    mtx.lock();
    bool finished = isFinished;
    mtx.unlock();

    return finished;
  }
};

vector<Process> processes;

void terminate() {
  cout << "All processes have finished executing" << endl;
}

void monitorTermination() {
  while (true) {
    // Check if all processes have finished executing
    bool allFinished = true;
    for (Process& process : processes) {
      if (!process.isFinished()) {
        allFinished = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    // If all processes have finished, terminate the system
    if (allFinished) {
      terminate();
      break;
    }

    // Wait for a short period before checking again
    this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(100));
  }
}

int main() {
  // Create a few processes
  processes.push_back(Process(0));
  processes.push_back(Process(1));
  processes.push_back(Process(2));

  // Start the processes
  for (Process& process : processes) {
    thread t(&Process::run, &process);
    t.detach();
  }

  // Start the termination monitor thread
  thread monitor(monitorTermination);

  monitor.join();

  return 0;
}
```

### Code Explanation:
This code implements a simple termination detection algorithm. Each process maintains a finished flag to indicate whether it has finished executing. A separate thread monitors the termination of all processes by periodically checking the finished flags of all processes. If all processes have finished executing, the monitor thread terminates the system.
The code uses a mutex to protect the finished flag of each process from concurrent access. This ensures that the monitor thread can accurately determine the termination status of each process.
