Human Computer Interaction/ Interface:- It is a methodology which focuses on designing a way in which human beings can interact with machines/computers in a more convenient and efficient manner.
If human is able to convey the intended task to the computer and computer successfully executes it without misinterpreting it, then the interaction between human and computer in this case can be considered as ideal.
GUI which is provided by operating systems can be one of the examples to understand HCI, which enables users to interact with the computer and provide easy access to resources of the computer in a convenient and efficient manner.

HCI is a multi-disciplinary subject:-
	-Psychology and Cognitive Science:- The process of understanding the perspective of human brain and accordingly making changes to the product is considered under this so that HCI becomes convenient.
	-Ergonomics:- While performing the task, the process should be productive and effortless for the user.
	-Sociology:- Understanding the structre of human society comes under this. Deals with understanding the interaction, relation and reaction of different people in the society with each other.
	-CS Engineering:- Basic knowledge of CS concepts should be with the human in order to interact with the computer.
	-Business:- Even if all the things are implemented perfectly, there is still the possibility that people are unaware of the product because the business aspect is not strong, so this is alos important aspect in HCI.
	-Graphics Design:- The actual interface that is visible to humans should be easy to understand and convenient to use.

Input/Output Channel in HCI:-
	-The output generated by the computer acts as input for the human and vice verca. for ex: computer geneates a pop up an duser responds by clicking "ok" or "cancel". We are more concerned with I/O w.r.t humans.
	
	-Input:- We have five main senses (Sight, Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste), out of these for HCI the first three (sight, hearing, touch) are the most important as far as HCI is concerned.
		-Sight:- Humans see the world around them as it is with their eyes. The eyes have mechanism which lets them adapt themselves to the extreme conditions (extreme brightness/dimness) as to view the surroundings in best way possible. But if we switch from these two conditions to and fro then it would damage the eye resulting in poor HCI. This is why features like brightness control, auto-brightness and night sight are present in the mobile and computer devices.
			-Visual angle:- The angle formed in front of the eye by the lines taken from top and bottom of the object is known as visual angle. ex: explain by taking two objects of different sizes.
			-Visual acuity:- The ability of a person to percieve fine details of an object is known as visual acuity. This is actually tested when visual angle is too small (i.e. object itself is so small/object is very far away). 
			Another thing is misinterpretation or disambiguity in the object which can be interpreted in more than one ways like "13" can understood as either numbers "13" or alphabet "B" in different scenarios. Other than this, font used should be readable such that users have to make least effort in reading it and most of the effort in interpreting it.
		-Hearing:- Hearing is another important sense which can give an idea about the position of the object by just understanding where the sound produces by it is coming from. In terms of HCI, when we try to increase the volume very much which is harmful for the ear, then computer gives a warning stating that haering at such volume may damage the ear.
		Touch:- The click on mouse and/or touch on teh keyboard can be considered as input for the computer and the feedback generated by the computer in form of haptics can be considered as response by the computer.

	-Output/effectors:- Major effectors in case of HCI are limbs, fingers, head/body position, voice.
		-fingers:- These are considered as one of the most important as these are mostly the ones that are used to generate input for the computer like clicking mouse, pressing keys on keyboard, toggling volume in a speaker etc.
		-limbs:- The machines which require fingers would definitely be requiring limbs (arms in most cases) as these are the base or core which are responsible for what fingers do.
		-head/body position:- some mechanism like lock/unlock system uses head position and some proctoring systems may use body positions as well
		-voice:- voice is also one of the most widely used format for HCI. ex: google assisstant, siri, alexa etc.

Human memory:- The primary task of memry is to store and retrieve data. The human memory is a vast topic in which research is still going on but w.r.t HCI, mainly these three are considered (sensory memory, short term memory, long term memory)
	-Sensory memory:- It acts as a buffer for the stimuli/response/input which is received from the senses. There exists sensory memory for respective sensory channel in our body.
		-Iconic memory:- for visual stimuli
		-Echoic memory:- for hearing stimuli
		-Haptic memory:- for touch stimuli
	The sensory memory keeps on updating w.r.t time so it is imporant to filter out important details and pass them on to the short term memory. This is known as Attention. for example: while blindfolded, touch and hearing stimuli becomes more important that visual stimuli and while driving visual and hearing becomes more important that touch stimuli.

	-Short term memory:- The data is stored for short time in case of short term memory. suppose we want to calculate 25*5 but we're not able to recall the table of 27 so we can break it down to (20*5 + 5*5) which is 125, the intermediate results used are used in something known as short term memory. another example, whenever we are given an unseen passage and need to find answers for some questions based on that passage, we read the passage and should store the context and maybe keywords inside the short term memory which will be used to find the answers to given questions. Access time of retrievng info from STM is very less. STM capacity can be increased by remembering the info in form of chunks rather than whole.

	-Long term memory:- The data is stored for a long time in case of LTM. The probability of forgetting the information stored in LTM is very less as compared to STM. LTM is generally categorised into episodic (the events are stored iin the same sequence in which they occures) and semantic (all the knowledge and facts gained).
		-Info store:- repeated exposure to a stimuli results in passing of info from STM to LTM
		-Loss of info:- the amount of info stored is limited so loss of info is natural. New info may replace old info. Some accidents may also result in loss of info from LTM.
		Retrieval of info:- When the need arrives, info is retrieved from the LTM.

Thinking: Reasoning and Problem solving
	-Thinking:- The developers and designers have to finalise their product by considering the thinking prespective of the users. The interface/software should be useful and understandable for different types of people.
	-Reasoning:- The use of available knwoledge to infer or conclude something.
		-Deductive:- use of previous statement to conclude future statement. ex: S1: If it rains, take an umbrella. S2: It is raining. From S1 we can conclude that take an umbrealla since it is raining. Deductive reasoning may sometimes generate meaningless inferences.
		-Inductive:- generalising from cases we have seen to infer information about cases we have not seen. ex: seeing an elephant with a trunk and generalising that all elephants in the world will have trunks.
		-Abductive:- Deriving the explaination of the events happening in our surroundings. ex: dhoni played extremely well, this is the reason india won the match today.
	-Problem Solving:- The use of available knowledge to solve an unfamiliar problem statement.
		-Reuse of knowledge:- learning from the process of problem that you previously solved and applying it to solve similar problem or subproblem in future.
		-Insight:- It is important to have in depth knowledge of the problem statement before proceding to solve it.

Norman's model of interaction:
	-Actors: Human and Computer
	-Phases: Execution phase and Evaluation phase
	The human gives provide an input to the computer and computer receives it. It then starts the execution and generate the result and show it to user. The user eveluates the output and match it with the desired output, if matched the cycle is over and if not user again modifies the input and proceed with the cycle until desired output is achieved.
	seven steps included in this process:
		-establishing the goal
		-forming the intention
		-secifying the action sequence
		-executing the action
		-perceiving the system state
		-interpreting the system state
		-evaluating the system state w.r.t goals and intentions
		ex:- task: read a book ad in a completely dark room, explain using above steps
	-Terms:
		-Domain: area of work/expertise
		-task: operation to manipulate concepts of domain
		-goal: desired output
		-intention: specific path taken to reach goal
		task analysis: identification of problem space for user in context of domain, task, goal, intention

	-Gulf of Execution:- Difference between the user formation/expectation of sequence of actions to reach the goal and the actual actions allowed by the computer. If these two match, then HCI is termed as ideal. So this should be as minimum as possible.

	-Gulf of Evaluation:- Difference between the physical presentation of system state and expectation of of user. That is, difference b/w the actual state of output generated and the expected state of it generated by user's mind. This should also be as minimum as possible.

-Ergonomics:- All the actions taken in order to increase overall productivity and efficiency of HCI comes under ergonomics. ex: eork environment, UI/UX, body posture etc.
	-arrangement of controls and display (table-chair arrangement, body posture)
	-the physical environment of interaction (workspace temperature, Display Light, Light from window/tubelight, Noise, Duration of work)
	-health issues (can occur if environment is bad)
	-the use of color (warning: cross/red color, completion: tick/green color, Display color, Battery symbol colors in smartphones (>40:green, <=40:orange, <=15:red))

-Interaction styles:-
	-direct manipulation:- interacting with system directly, like with a mouse, keyboard
	-command line:- CLI used in Windows, UNIX etc. in which user types a command and if the command is syntactically and semantically correct, computer generates respective output. easier for machine, a bit complex for humans
	-menu:- various options are provided to the humans so that they can choose the option which is most convinient to them. ex: different payment options(UPI, debit/credit card, internet banking, cash)
	-natural language:- it is very difficult for the machine to understand NL as it is very ambiguous as one word or sentence can be interpreted in more than one forms.
	-question answer and query:- the user performs a query and system is supposed to generate the desired result.
	-form fills:- the data to be entered should match with the respective attribute in which we entering it. ex: for "name", the numbers should not be allowed generally.
	-point and click interface:- pointing to a specific word/sentence and shown a pop-up to know its meaning and/or hyperlink which takes to the info about that word (touch screen also come under this)
	3D interface:- incorporated on various app icons to make them look more attractive. VR and AR also come under this
		AR:- Augmented Reality (AR) morphs the mundane, physical world into a colorful by creating 3D pictures or videos. It is as if those virtual objects are actually present in the real world. Almost anyone can access this using their smartphones by using its camera. ex: Pokemon Go
		VR:- Virtual Reality (VR) takes it to next level by producing an entirely computer-genrated simulation of a virtual environment. It is as if the user himself is present in that environment. To access these as of now, VR gadgets like glasses and controllers are used. ex: VR videogames, metaverse

	-WIMP interface: Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers
		-Windows:- 
			-whatever we percieve ater booting up a computer on its monitor screen can be considered under this. Text (in human language), graphics, icons, images etc.
			-can be more than one windows
			-scroll bars
			-minimise, maximise, close buttons for current window

		-Icons:-
			-Smaller picture with app logo which is used as shortcut to open that app, making the access easy
			-must be easy to interpret, unique and easy to remember by the user

		-Menus:-
			-user is provided with varous options and he/she can choose as per their convenience
			-If multiple items present in menu, group them on basis of their similarities, this is caled cascading

		-Pointers:-
			-pointing and selecting icons or perform a specific task like opening or closing a file
			-like mouse arrow
			-arrows used to increase/decrease size of window

		-Dialogue box:-
			-convey an urgent info to the user
			-decision by the user (accept/reject)
			-save or not
			-warning/alert

		-Toolbars:-
			-vertical/horizontal placed on the screen
			-found in web browser/word processing apps



To do:
	-Object Action Interface Model (OAI)
		-extension of GUI
		-helps to improve HCI and productivity of the task
		-prioritises the objects over the actions (i.e. it emphasizes the object being selected first, and then any action performed on it)
		-The sequence of work is to first select the object graphically (using mouse or other pointing device), and then performing an action on the selected object
		-It emulates WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)

	-Main tasks in HCI (data entry, info display, navigation across screen)
		-data entyr: user's input is systems' output and vice versa
		-info display: based on the input given by the user
		-navigaton across screen: use of mouse/keyboard/voice command

	-Fitts's law:- Paul fitts developed a model that describes how quickly people can select a target. It says that time to acquire a target is function of size of the target and distance to the target.
		MT = a + b * log2 (2D/W)
		MT: time to select the target
		a,d: constants set by type of device
		D: distance from starting point to target
		W: width of target along axis of motion
	large and closer objects have lower interaction cost, small and farther objects have greater interaction cost.
	used to design websites, interfaces etc. such that HCI becomes more user convenient

	-paradigm of interactions: An interaction paradigm is a model or pattern of human–computer interaction that encompasses all aspects of interaction, including physical, virtual, perceptual, and cognitive.
		-time sharing systems (same OS wala, process ki jagah user)
		-video display unit:- A video display unit (VDU) consists of: A computer output device that uses a cathode ray tube or other technology to present visual images. One or more input devices, such as a keyboard , a mouse , or both.
		-programming toolkit:- a way to encapsulate interface design concepts for programmers, including widget sets, interface builders, and development envi- ronments.
		-personal computing
		-the metaphor:- A metaphor is a mapping process from a familiar object to an unfamiliar object, and it provides the framework to familiarize an unknown concept through a mapping process.
		-direct manipulation:- real time interaction b/w user and computer where user directly interacts with system by use of let say mouse and computer responds accordingly
		-language vs action paradigm:- The language/action perspective "takes language as the primary dimension of human cooperative activity"
		-hypertext paradigm
		-multimodality paradigm:- composed of the comprehensive usage of various input and output channels
		-computer supported cooperative work:- Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) is a related term that is associated with groupware. CSCW does not refer to a particular set of software tools, however, in the same way that groupware does. Instead, CSCW is the study of people working together, using computer-based tools such as groupware.
		-WWW (world wide web):- collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet.
		-agent based interfaces:- Interface agents are computer programs that provide personalized assistance to users with their computer-based tasks.
		-ubiquitous computing:- involves adaptive to situation and support for multimodal of interaction with the user. This requires some sort of intelligence work integrated with interaction paradigm.
		-sensor based and context aware:- Context-aware systems have the ability of adapting their behavior to their current operational context. Context changes are often triggered by events generated by sensors, like changes in location, time and communication involving people other than the user.
